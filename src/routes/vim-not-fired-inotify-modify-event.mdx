Things start as I found [rathole](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole) has a [weird implementation](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole/issues/231) on their config hot-reload.

After I made a pr, developer point to another [issue](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole/pull/122) which explained this is a workaround specifically for vim,
which not fired `modify` inotify event during modifying.

Let's make an experiment:

Create ./t, then touch file `a`:

```bash
mkdir t
cd t
touch a
```

We have full control to this dir recursively.
Then make a inotify watch continuedly:

```
nix-shell -p inotify-tools
```

```
inotifywatch -v -z -t 10 -r t/a
```

This will watch the inotify event on file a in 10s.

We took some actions:

```bash
cd t
vim a
# wirte something

:wq
```

Ok, see what catches:

```
~ ❄️  impure  36s
> inotifywatch -v -z -t 10 -r t/a

Establishing watches...
Setting up watch(es) on t/a
OK, t/a is now being watched.
Total of 1 watches.
Finished establishing watches, now collecting statistics.
Will listen for events for 10 seconds.
total  access  modify  attrib  close_write  close_nowrite  open  moved_from  moved_to  move_self  create  delete  delete_self  filename
9      1       0       1       0            2              2     0           0         1          0       0       1            t/a
```

No modify event, but expect to have that:

```bash
echo "test" >> a
```

This action fired modify event successfully as expected:

```
~ ❄️  impure  6m37s
> inotifywatch -v -z -t 3 -r t/a

Establishing watches...
Setting up watch(es) on t/a
OK, t/a is now being watched.
Total of 1 watches.
Finished establishing watches, now collecting statistics.
Will listen for events for 3 seconds.
total  access  modify  attrib  close_write  close_nowrite  open  moved_from  moved_to  move_self  create  delete  delete_self  filename
3      0       1       0       1            0              1     0           0         0          0       0       0            t/a
```

Take sight back to result of vim modified, here is a `move_self` event, as [this article](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/25030/vim-not-firing-inotify-events-when-writing-file) mentioned,
vim default set `backupcopy=no`, which caused behaviors that the original file is renamed to create a backup and a new file with the original name is created. This would not trigger the `modify` event but the `close_write` of parent directory and `move_self` of itself.

Turn this option to yes means to copy the file to create a backup and then overwrite the original, thus inotify will trigger.

Under my test only vim has this problem, `nano` and `helix` both trigger the event normally.

Is there a more graceful way to watch the file change modified by vim ?
